# School-System-In-ASP.Net
Simple school system  has built in ASP.Net that performs basic operations like CRUD for Classes, Teachers, Subjects, etc ..

# Focuse on:
- Visual Studio 2019.
- Sql Server 2020.

# Important details:
- I had downloaded many extensions that helped me to make migration.
- You will find a file named ' SchoolSystem.bak ' => this is a copy of database so inside your Sql server you have to use this command
 ( RESTORE DATABASE SchoolSystem FROM DISK = 'Enter the path of copied databse'; )
 to restore database into your Sql Server ..
